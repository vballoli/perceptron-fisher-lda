# BITS F464 Machine Learning Assignment 1

This repository contains code and dataset for implementing Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis and the Perceptron Algorithm.


## Perceptron Algorithm

The perceptron algorithm implemented uses the activation function: f(x) = 1 if x >= threshold else -1, threshold usually set to zero.

`images/` folder contains GIFs of the change of decision boundary as the perceptron updates the weight vector based on the error of prediction.
